    <h2>Add Several New Elements With append() and prepend()</h2>
    <p>In both examples above, we have only inserted some text/HTML at the beginning/end of the selected HTML elements.

        However, both the append() and prepend() methods can take an infinite number of new elements as parameters. The
        new elements can be generated with text/HTML (like we have done in the examples above), with jQuery, or with
        JavaScript code and DOM elements.

        In the following example, we create several new elements. The elements are created with text/HTML, jQuery, and
        JavaScript/DOM. Then we append the new elements to the text with the append() method (this would have worked for
        prepend() too) :</p>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <button onclick="appendText()">Append text</button>
</body>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
    function appendText() {
        let txt1 = "<p>Text.</p>";        // Create text with HTML
        let txt2 = $("<p></p>").text("Text.");  // Create text with jQuery
        let txt3 = document.createElement("p");
        txt3.innerHTML = "Text.";         // Create text with DOM
        $("body").append(txt1, txt2, txt3);   // Append new elements
    }
</script>
