    <h2>jQuery Callback Functions</h2>
    <p>JavaScript statements are executed line by line. However, with effects, the next line of code can be run even
        though the effect is not finished. This can create errors.
        <br>
        To prevent this, you can create a callback function.
        <br>
        A callback function is executed after the current effect is finished.
